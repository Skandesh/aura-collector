## The Aura System Explained 🌟

### Core Concept

Users collect **aura points** by completing tasks. Aura represents discipline, self-improvement momentum, and personal energy.

### Task System

- **5 Categories**: Physical, Mental, Social, Productivity, Habits
- **4 Difficulty Levels**: Easy (5-15 pts), Medium (20-30 pts), Hard (40-60 pts), Legendary (80-150 pts)
- **Task Types**: Daily, Weekly, Once, Anytime
- **Custom Tasks**: Users can create their own

### Progression

- **10 Aura Levels**: Dormant → Awakening → Kindling → Flickering → Steady → Radiant → Blazing → Brilliant → Transcendent → Legendary
- **Achievements**: 40+ unlockable achievements
- **Streaks**: Preserved from v1.0, now tied to task completion
- **Statistics**: Detailed tracking by category, difficulty, and time

### Gamification

- Visual aura effects
- Level-up celebrations
- Achievement unlocks
- Combo multipliers
- Daily challenges
- Progress insights

---

## What's Preserved from v1.0? 💾

Your existing habit tracking system is **completely preserved**:

- ✅ Current streak
- ✅ Best streak
- ✅ Daily records
- ✅ Streak history
- ✅ All user data

During migration:

- Existing users get "Legacy" achievements
- Best streak becomes "Peak Discipline" achievement
- Aura points awarded based on historical streak
- All data transitions seamlessly

---

## Your Current State 📊

### ✅ What's Ready

- Type definitions complete
- Task library populated (50+ tasks)
- Aura levels defined (10 levels)
- Achievements created (40+)
- Documentation comprehensive
- Migration strategy planned

### ⏳ What's Next (To Build)

- Components (TaskCard, AuraLevelBadge, etc.)
- AuraContext (state management)
- Task completion logic
- Aura calculation system
- Updated screens/UI
- Data migration script
- Testing & refinement

## Getting Started NOW 🚀

### Option 1: Follow the Quick Start (Recommended)

1. Open `QUICKSTART.md`
2. Follow the 40-minute tutorial
3. Build your first task viewing feature
4. See immediate results!

### Option 2: Explore the Codebase

1. Read through `constants/tasks.ts` - see all the tasks
2. Check out `constants/auraLevels.ts` - understand progression
3. Review `types/aura.ts` - understand data structure
4. Plan your approach

### Option 3: Jump to Advanced

1. Read `TRANSITION_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. Start building AuraContext
3. Implement task completion logic
4. Update UI screens

---

## Key Design Decisions Made 🎨

1. **Preserve Legacy**: Don't throw away v1.0 data - migrate it
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with task viewing, add complexity gradually
3. **Gamify Thoughtfully**: Make it fun but not overwhelming
4. **Multiple Categories**: Appeal to different improvement areas
5. **Flexible System**: Allow custom tasks and adjustable difficulty
6. **Visual Feedback**: Animations, colors, badges for engagement
7. **Privacy First**: Everything stored locally (for now)

## Questions to Consider 🤔

As you build, think about:

### UX Questions

- How many tasks should be shown at once?
- Should completed tasks be hidden or shown?
- How prominent should the aura counter be?
- What animations feel right for task completion?

### Game Design Questions

- Are aura point values balanced?
- Should there be limits on tasks per day?
- Should aura decay if inactive?
- How to make it addictive but healthy?

### Technical Questions

- Pagination strategy for large task lists?
- Caching strategy for performance?
- How to handle offline mode?
- Migration rollback plan?
